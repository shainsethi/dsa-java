# Java DSA Course 🚀

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repo contains a comprehensive guide to DSA in Java, starting from the logic-building phase with flowcharts up to advanced implementations.

## 📌 Logic Building: Flowcharts
If you are a beginner, it is highly recommended to start with the logic-building section. If you already have programming experience, you can skip to the Java code.

- **Practice Solutions**: [Detailed Flowchart Solutions](./FlowCharts/SOLUTION.md)

### Topics Covered in Flowcharts:
- Basic Arithmetic (Sum of Numbers, Simple Interest)
- Conditionals (Greatest of 3 Numbers)
- Loops & Iteration (Sum of N Numbers)
- Logic Optimization (Prime Number checking)

## 💻 Java Source Code
