# Java DSA Course 🚀

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repo contains a comprehensive guide to DSA in Java, starting from the logic-building phase with flowcharts up to advanced implementations.

## 📌 Logic Building: Flowcharts
If you are a beginner, it is highly recommended to start with the logic-building section. If you already have programming experience, you can skip to the Java code.

- **Main Guide**: [Flowchart Components & Examples](./FlowCharts/FLOWCHART.md)
- **Practice Solutions**: [Detailed Flowchart Solutions](./FlowCharts/SOLUTION.md)

### Topics Covered in Flowcharts:
- Basic Arithmetic (Sum of Numbers, Simple Interest)
- Conditionals (Greatest of 3 Numbers)
- Loops & Iteration (Sum of N Numbers)
- Logic Optimization (Prime Number checking)

## 💻 Java Source Code

### Module 1: Variables & Data Types
Master the fundamentals of Java programming, including memory management, input/output, and type casting.

- **Main Guide**: [Variables & Data Types Concepts](./Variables/VARIABLES.md)
- **Core Code**: [Variables.java](./Variables/Variables.java)
- **Practice Solutions**: [Java Solutions](./Variables/Solutions/)

### Module 2: Operators
Understand symbols and expressions that manipulate variables and logic.

- **Main Guide**: [Operators Concepts](./Operators/OPERATORS.md)
- **Core Code**: [Operators.java](./Operators/Operators.java)
- **Practice Solutions**: [Java Solutions](./Operators/SOLUTIONS.md)

### Module 3: Conditional Statements
Master the control flow of Java applications using `if-else`, `switch`, and ternary operators.

- **Main Guide**: [Conditional Statements Concepts](./ConditionalStatements/CONDITIONALSTATEMENTS.md)
- **Core Code**: [ConditionalStatements.java](./ConditionalStatements/ConditionalStatements.java)
- **Practice Solutions**: [Java Solutions](./ConditionalStatements/Solutions/)
