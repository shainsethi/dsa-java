# Patterns in Java 🎨

Patterns are a great way to master nested loops and logic building. To identify the logic behind any pattern, follow these three simple steps:

1. **Count the lines**: How many rows does the pattern have? (Outer loop)
2. **Identify the columns**: For each row, how many items (stars, numbers, characters) are printed? (Inner loop)
3. **Determine the content**: What exactly needs to be printed? (The value inside the inner loop)

## Available Pattern Programs

- **Star Pattern**: [StarPattern.java](./StarPattern.java) - Prints a right-angled star triangle.
- **Inverted Star Pattern**: [InvertedStarPattern.java](./InvertedStarPattern.java) - Prints an inverted star triangle.
- **Half Pyramid Pattern**: [HalfPyramidPattern.java](./HalfPyramidPattern.java) - Prints numbers in a pyramid shape.
- **Character Pattern**: [CharacterPattern.java](./CharacterPattern.java) - Prints characters (A, BC, DEF...) in sequence.
